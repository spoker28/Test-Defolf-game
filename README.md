# Introduction
[Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) is an open technology that allows someone viewing a webpage or playing a web game to stream very small payments (micropayments) to the creator in real time. It is an exciting new and non-intrusive way for game developers to monetize their web games while at the same time offering premium content to their paying players.

# Configuration
Add your payment pointer to [game.project](defold://open?path=/game.project) in the Web Monetization section. Payment pointers are provided by a number of different [companies offering digital wallets](https://defold.com/extension-webmonetization/#web-monetization-wallets).
